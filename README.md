# Feedreader testing

This is a Udacity project that involves building a testing suite using 
[Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) for a web app that reads RSS feeds.

## Installation

To install, clone the git repository, navigate into the directory 
and install the node modules.

```
git clone https://github.com/bkantiques/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader.git
cd frontent-nanodegree-feedreader
npm install
```

The project has BrowserSync installed so users can automatically reload
the project when `app.js` or `feedreader.js` are changed. To run BrowserSync,
open a browser and in the project's root directory run 'grunt browserSync'. 
This should open the project in the browser.
